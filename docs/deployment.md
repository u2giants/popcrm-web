# Deployment — poppim-web

See `AGENTS.md` §13 for the summary. This is the **actual** current process, not an ideal one.

## Current state: serving PRODUCTION via raw Docker
`poppim-web` is **live in production at `https://pm.designflow.app`** (cutover 2026-06-11) — but it is **not yet a Coolify-managed app or a CI pipeline.** It runs as a locally-built image attached to Coolify's existing Traefik proxy, with one container serving both `pm.designflow.app` (production) and `pm-dev.designflow.app` (alias).

**Cutover notes:** `pm` was repointed from the Directus backend to this container — the backend dropped `pm` from its Coolify sub-app `fqdn` (`service_applications` id=16, now `data.designflow.app` only) and `pm` was added to `AUTH_MICROSOFT_REDIRECT_ALLOW_LIST`. Directus Data Studio now lives only at `data.designflow.app`.

**Why temporary:** the `gh` token on the build host lacks `write:packages`, so GHCR is unavailable, and a Coolify git-build isn't wired up. This deviates from the org standard (deploy via Coolify + GitHub Actions → registry → Coolify) and is tracked as open work (AGENTS.md §15).

## Build + deploy the preview
```bash
# 1. build the image (multi-stage node→nginx; nginx.conf = SPA fallback)
npm run build
docker build -t poppim-web:latest .

# 2. (re)run the container on Coolify's proxy network with Traefik labels
docker rm -f poppim-web 2>/dev/null
docker run -d --name poppim-web --restart unless-stopped --network coolify \
  --label "traefik.enable=true" \
  --label 'traefik.http.routers.poppimweb-http.entryPoints=http' \
  --label 'traefik.http.routers.poppimweb-http.rule=Host(`pm.designflow.app`) || Host(`pm-dev.designflow.app`)' \
  --label 'traefik.http.routers.poppimweb-http.service=poppimweb' \
  --label 'traefik.http.routers.poppimweb-https.entryPoints=https' \
  --label 'traefik.http.routers.poppimweb-https.rule=Host(`pm.designflow.app`) || Host(`pm-dev.designflow.app`)' \
  --label 'traefik.http.routers.poppimweb-https.tls=true' \
  --label 'traefik.http.routers.poppimweb-https.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt' \
  --label 'traefik.http.routers.poppimweb-https.service=poppimweb' \
  --label 'traefik.http.services.poppimweb.loadbalancer.server.port=80' \
  poppim-web:latest
```
Traefik (the `coolify-proxy` container) routes `pm-dev.designflow.app` to it and issues a Let's Encrypt cert (HTTP challenge). DNS `pm-dev` → the VPS is a Cloudflare A record (DNS-only).

## Runtime config
`VITE_*` is baked at build time (static SPA) — there is no runtime env. To change the backend URL, rebuild.

## Rollback
Rebuild from a known-good commit and re-run, or `docker run` a previously-tagged image.

## SSH / direct-docker
Raw `docker run` on the host **is** the current deploy path — **exceptional and temporary**. The standard (this org) is deploy-via-Coolify + CI; do not treat raw-docker as the permanent process.

## Planned (open work)
Stand up a real **Coolify app** for `poppim-web` at `pm.designflow.app`: GHCR image + GitHub Actions (build → push → trigger Coolify), or a Coolify git-build. When that lands, add `.github/workflows/` and rewrite this doc.
